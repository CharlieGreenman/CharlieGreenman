## About ME
I’m Charlie Greenman, a New-York–based tech entrepreneur, software architect, and self-professed quadrifecta developer—equally at home in DevOps, backend, frontend, and generative-AI R&D. After years of building for everyone from scrappy startups to enterprise clients, I founded Razroo, where we turn bleeding-edge AI into practical leverage for real people. 

### What I do

Architect & ship AI-first products
 • Created an AI ticketing engine that spins up 30–40 actionable Jira issues in seconds.
 • Designed a memory × semantic-search layer that lets assistants anticipate user needs long before they ask.

Lead elite, “micro-but-mighty” teams
 I believe five exceptional engineers out-execute fifty average ones—and I build cultures that prove it.

Champion human-centric tech
From blockchain-based data privacy to AI-powered firefighting concepts, my work centers on raising quality of life, not just quarterly numbers.

### Teams I've Managed

During my time building Razroo, the company and its products at [razroo.com](razroo.com), I've had the privilege of welcoming over 100 people into Razroo's Slack Channel. 
In our heyday, we had 25 people a part of the organization reporting directly to me. These days, while Razroo's IP is arguably worth millions of dollars, our organization is a bit smaller. 
However, in the near future, our hope is that our products and services will be ubiquitous in the B2B space. 

### How I think

* Utility-first mindset (Tailwind, GraphQL, serverless)
* Future-focused writing (AGI architecture, UBI, AI compression)
* Community & ownership 501(c)(3) founder, open-knowledge advocate, believer in sharing upside with contributors.

### Why connect

If you’re exploring AI that empowers, prefer simple, elegant solutions, and value speed with substance, let’s talk. Whether you need a fractional CTO, a sounding board for an ambitious idea, or a partner to co-create the next leap forward, I’m game.

Shoot me a message—let’s build something that matters.

## Publications 

### Angular: The Full Gamut (700 page book)
Book on Angular, written before ChatGPT happened: https://github.com/razroo/angular-content

I wrote about 600 of these pages riding on QM4 bus between Queens and Manhattan. I lived in Washington Heights for a while, consulting for Columbia University. When I did I wrote this book while on the Uber on the way there and back(yes I make money. 

Can see gumroad mini books as well: 

- Ngrx/store: https://razroo.gumroad.com/l/ngrx-store
- Angular Unit Testing: https://razroo.gumroad.com/l/angular-unit-testing

### Razroo Blog
[blog.razroo.com](blog.razroo.com)

About 200 of my articles are on the Razroo blog. Like an idiot, I delete about 70 from Medium and messed up my SEO to move to this blog. Learn from me and don't do that. Double post on both sorts, but... we now have AI, so yeah. 

### Medium
My medium is https://charliegreenman.medium.com/. I tend to put new thought pieces here. I was once averaging about 300,000 views a month, before once again like an idiot I deleted my Medium post. Lesson learnt. 
Also I'm sorry to the thousands of codebases that reference those articles that no longer exist (didn't think about that either when I deleted).
