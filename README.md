## About ME
I'm Charlie Greenman, a New-York–based tech entrepreneur, software architect, and self-professed quadrifecta developer—equally at home in DevOps, backend, frontend, and generative-AI R&D. After years of building for everyone from scrappy startups to enterprise clients, I founded Razroo, where we turn bleeding-edge AI into practical leverage for real people.

### What I do

Architect & ship AI-first products
 • Created an AI ticketing engine that spins up 30–40 actionable Jira issues in seconds.
 • Designed a memory × semantic-search layer that lets assistants anticipate user needs long before they ask.

Lead elite, "micro-but-mighty" teams
 I believe five exceptional engineers out-execute fifty average ones—and I build cultures that prove it.

Champion human-centric tech
From blockchain-based data privacy to AI-powered firefighting concepts, my work centers on raising quality of life, not just quarterly numbers.

### Teams I've Managed

During my time building Razroo, the company and its products at [razroo.com](razroo.com), I've had the privilege of welcoming over 100 people into Razroo's Slack Channel. 
In our heyday, we had 25 people a part of the organization reporting directly to me. These days, while Razroo's IP is arguably worth millions of dollars, our organization is a bit smaller. 
However, in the near future, our hope is that our products and services will be ubiquitous in the B2B space. 

### How I think

* Utility-first mindset (Tailwind, GraphQL, serverless)
* Future-focused writing (AGI architecture, UBI, AI compression)
* Community & ownership 501(c)(3) founder, open-knowledge advocate, believer in sharing upside with contributors.

### Why connect

If you're exploring AI that empowers, prefer simple, elegant solutions, and value speed with substance, let's talk. Whether you need a fractional CTO, a sounding board for an ambitious idea, or a partner to co-create the next leap forward, I'm game.

Shoot me a message—let's build something that matters.

## Publications 

### Angular: The Full Gamut (700 page book)
Book on Angular, written before ChatGPT happened: https://github.com/razroo/angular-content

I wrote about 600 of these pages riding on QM4 bus between Queens and Manhattan. I lived in Washington Heights for a while, consulting for Columbia University. When I did I wrote this book while on the Uber on the way there and back(yes I make money). 

Can see gumroad mini books as well: 

- Ngrx/store: https://razroo.gumroad.com/l/ngrx-store
- Angular Unit Testing: https://razroo.gumroad.com/l/angular-unit-testing

### Razroo Blog
[blog.razroo.com](https://blog.razroo.com)

About 200 of my articles are on the Razroo blog. Like an idiot, I deleted about 70 articles from Medium and messed up my SEO to move to this blog. Learn from me and don't do that. Double post on both sorts, but... we now have AI, so yeah. 

### Medium
My medium is https://charliegreenman.medium.com/. I tend to put new thought pieces here. I was once averaging about 300,000 views a month, before once again like an idiot I deleted my Medium post. Lesson learnt. 

Also I'm sorry to the thousands of codebases that reference those articles that no longer exist (didn't think about that either when I deleted). 

## Companies I've Worked For (timeline from bottom up and past companies only w/ exception of Razroo the company. Razroo is forever lasting.)

* 🚀 **Razroo** - Technical Founder building AI-powered code generation tools and ticketing systems (2018-Present)
* ♻️ **Republic Services** - Python and React for their AI Chat Application (3 months - post 25% industry-wide pay cuts. Would have never left if understood industry better.)
* 🎓 **Ruffalo Noel Levitz** - AI Chat application (worked at for negligable amount of time. During a chaotic shift in industry, in hindsight should have never joined.)
* 💳 **Capital One** - Full stack engineer on Enterprise payments system (6 months via Razroo - left post Capital One making an increased Hybrid push)
* 🏥 **ASCO** - Senior Software Engineer migrating Enterprise Angular applications (2 years via Razroo - AI and Covid caused budget cuts)
* 🎓 **Columbia University** - Senior Software Engineer on course management system (2 years via Razroo - was great but Covid caused budget cuts)
* 📊 **Datasite One** - UI Architect for M&A applications leading 3-4 engineers (3 years via Razroo - best director of engineering I ever worked for ❤️)
* 📱 **Verizon** - Software Engineer and Front End Architect for Oath advertising platform (2016-2017 - I worked remote pre-Covid. The few the proud.)
* ⚖️ **Rubenstein Technology Group** - Front End Software Engineer for AM100 law firm solutions (2015-2016 - engineering talent punched well above it's weight)
* 🐴 **Pegasus Solutions** - Took charge of architecting the entire front-end stack for the booking engine. (2015-2015 - was a great starting place. Got job by answering question on recursion. Fond memories)
* 🏢 **Omnium Group** - Front End Engineer across multiple client projects and ventures (2010-2015 - Thank you to my brother for giving me a start 💚)

*I blame my overly amibitous younger self(went to 6 figures in 1.5 years by age 24, and doubled that amount by 26, so who is to blame? I thought I would continue to double amount in the next 3 years, but industry started changing.) Entreprenuership, living overseas for five years, Covid-19(non-remote to remote, and then back to non-remote wrecked alot of teams) and December 2023 AKA AI Doom Month(I lost two contracts that month), for the amount of companies I worked for. Also the industry has taken pay cuts for the first time in past 15 years. I didn't understand that until recently and was very unhappy with roles I had a year ago, which is why I left two of those roles.*

## Cities I've Lived
- 🚀 Houston, TX (most space to roam + spacious suburbs)
- 🏠 Chicago, IL (very homey)
- 🎓 Queens, NY (college. I'm not a big fan of queens)
- 🏢 Long Island, NY (work, I loved being only person during winter chilling on the Long Beach boardwalk)
- 🗽 Manhattan, NY (favorite city, but also why am i here? I live in a box, and playing music annoys my neighbors.)
- 🍯 Jerusalem, IL (world's best food, yes.)
- 🏖️ Tel Aviv, IL (beaches, tech and even better people)
- 🇬🇧 London, UK (work + world's best countryside)
- 💡 SF, CA (world's best founders and co)
- ☀️ Los Angeles, CA (world's best weather + breezy)
- 💰 Silver Spring, MD (work/cheap but still near stuff. Airbnb host called me quietest guest she ever had. That stuck with me for some reason. Like WTF are other guests doing? Anywho, I believe in traditional marriage.)
- 👥 Arlington, VA (work, but surprisingly alot of people)
- 🌿 Alexandria, VA (leafy overture)

*As you can see I've been around. Most likely due to my complicated past with religion. Did you know I was once offered to be ordained as an Orthodox Rabbi as early as age 18 nonetheless? (Present day me is no longer religious, atleast in the strict sense of the word. I apologize to my father who is a rabbi, my grandfather who is a rabbi etc. Tesla's father was a priest, Wright brothers father was a bishop, Houdini's father a Rabbi, Joseph Gutnick a Rabbi etc so I guess in good company.) In the arena as they say.*
