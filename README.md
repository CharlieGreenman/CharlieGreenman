## About ME
I’m Charlie Greenman, a New-York–based tech entrepreneur, software architect, and self-professed quadrifecta developer—equally at home in DevOps, backend, frontend, and generative-AI R&D. After years of building for everyone from scrappy startups to enterprise clients, I founded Razroo, where we turn bleeding-edge AI into practical leverage for real people. 

### What I do

Architect & ship AI-first products
 • Created an AI ticketing engine that spins up 30–40 actionable Jira issues in seconds.
 • Designed a memory × semantic-search layer that lets assistants anticipate user needs long before they ask.

Lead elite, “micro-but-mighty” teams
 I believe five exceptional engineers out-execute fifty average ones—and I build cultures that prove it.

Champion human-centric tech
From blockchain-based data privacy to AI-powered firefighting concepts, my work centers on raising quality of life, not just quarterly numbers.

### Teams I've Managed

During my time building Razroo, the company and its products at [razroo.com](razroo.com), I've had the privilege of welcoming over 100 people into Razroo's Slack Channel. 
In our heyday, we had 25 people a part of the organization reporting directly to me. These days, while Razroo's IP is arguably worth millions of dollars, our organization is a bit smaller. 
However, in the near future, our hope is that our products and services will be ubiquitous in the B2B space. 

### How I think

* Utility-first mindset (Tailwind, GraphQL, serverless)
* Future-focused writing (AGI architecture, UBI, AI compression)
* Community & ownership 501(c)(3) founder, open-knowledge advocate, believer in sharing upside with contributors.

### Why connect

If you’re exploring AI that empowers, prefer simple, elegant solutions, and value speed with substance, let’s talk. Whether you need a fractional CTO, a sounding board for an ambitious idea, or a partner to co-create the next leap forward, I’m game.

Shoot me a message—let’s build something that matters.
