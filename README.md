### [![committers.top badge](https://user-badge.committers.top/worldwide_private/Octomerger.svg)](https://user-badge.committers.top/worldwide_private/Octomerger) Hi there I'm Charlie Greenman ðŸ‘‹


This meme for now sums me up * barks * #GotThatDawgInMe

<hr>

I spend most of my time consulting for the world's best companies. 

<hr>

I'm also the Founder of [Razroo](razroo.com) A Software Architect As An Application. 

If you are new developer trying to get an Angular job, Razroo will change your life. You can use [razroo.com](razroo.com) to guide you autonomously toward creating an enterprise-grade application with experience. The sort of experience that teams are looking for in order to hire you. This would have saved me as a new dev 6-12 months of learning due to misdirection.

I say this as a fellow friend.

If you are a new developer, looking to get an Angular job, please use [razroo.com](razroo.com). It will make all the difference in your life.
