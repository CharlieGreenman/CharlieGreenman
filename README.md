I spend most of my time consulting for the world's best companies.

Also, a notable shout out to Razroo. I work with the team over at [Razroo](https://razroo.com) A Software Architect As An Application. 

If you are a new developer trying to get an Angular job. You can use [razroo.com](razroo.com) to guide you autonomously toward creating an enterprise-grade application with experience. The sort of experience that teams are looking for in order to hire you. This would have saved me as a new dev 6-12 months of learning due to misdirection.
