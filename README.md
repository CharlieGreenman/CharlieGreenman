I spend most of my time consulting for the world's best companies.

I'm also the Founder of [Razroo](https://razroo.com) A Software Architect As An Application. 

If you are new developer trying to get an Angular job, Razroo will change your life. You can use [razroo.com](razroo.com) to guide you autonomously toward creating an enterprise-grade application with experience. The sort of experience that teams are looking for in order to hire you. This would have saved me as a new dev 6-12 months of learning due to misdirection.

I say this as a fellow friend.

If you are a new developer, looking to get an Angular job, please use [Razroo](https://razroo.com). It will make all the difference in your life.
